/* to make it apply the style to the decendants 
you put the element type after the class.
You can get specific like #parentID #childID p 
and also you can just do it for a specific element like
.text instead of p*/

.container p{
    color: #ff0000;
    background-color: #ffff00;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 20px;
